<p>IP Address:
An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. IP addresses are used for identifying and locating devices within a network. There are two main versions of IP addresses currently in use: IPv4 and IPv6.

Network ID and Host ID:
In IP addressing, the network ID and host ID help to identify the network a device belongs to and the specific device within that network, respectively.

Network ID: This part of the IP address identifies the network to which the device belongs. It is used by routers to determine how to forward packets within a network or to other networks. The network ID occupies a portion of the IP address, and the remaining portion is reserved for identifying hosts within that network.

Host ID: This part of the IP address identifies the specific device within the network. It distinguishes one device from another within the same network. The host ID occupies the remaining portion of the IP address after the network ID.

Default Gateway:
The default gateway is a device (usually a router) on a network that serves as an access point to another network, typically the Internet. When a device needs to communicate with a device on another network, it sends the data packets to the default gateway, which then forwards them to the appropriate destination network. The default gateway is configured on each device to enable communication with devices outside its own network.

Relationships:

Network ID and Host ID: The network ID and host ID together form the complete IP address of a device. The network ID helps routers determine how to forward packets within a network, while the host ID helps identify the specific device within that network.

Default Gateway and IP Address: The default gateway is configured on each device with an IP address from the same network as the device's IP address. When a device needs to communicate with a device outside its own network (such as accessing the Internet), it sends the data packets to the default gateway, which forwards them to the appropriate destination network.

Understanding these components is crucial for configuring and troubleshooting network connectivity issues.</p>
